	<h1>Want to build your twitter-bootstrap theme faster? </h1>
		<p>We first developed bootstrap-magic so we could create our themes a lot faster. We developed these features and techniques in bootstrap-magic so that you, too, can become a bootstrap theme master:</p>
	
	<h3>1. Awesome typeahead</h3>
		<p class="lead">You don't have to type out variables and Less functions every time. Defined variables (starting with <code>@</code>) and Less functions (like <code>darken(@color,10%)</code>) will automatically appear in a list as you start typing. Prediction + autocomplete = awesome typeahead</p>
		
	<h3>3. Contextual and live preview</h3>
		<p class="lead">Change a variable and you can see the result immediately. No scrolling to check the impact of what you changed.</p>
	
	<h3>2. Reusable variables</h3>
		<p class="lead">You can specify your main <strong>"Brand Colors"</strong> with a new set of variables that we have defined.  You can base the other colors in your theme off of these main colors. This technique will give you a well coordinated and good looking theme.</p>
		
	<h3>4. New and imported variables accepted</h3>
		<p class="lead">If you already have variables defined, you can import them right into boostrap-magic. You can even create your own new custom variables.</p>
		
	<h3>5. Colorpicker </h3>
		<p class="lead">The colorpicker tool lets you easily see and choose colors so you can find just the right ones for your theme.</p>
